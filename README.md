# RobuRishabh-Driver-for-VectorNav-VN-100-Inertial-Measurement-Unit-to-parse-VNYMR
Collected roughly 5 hours and 15 minutes worth of stationary IMU data at a location that is not subject to vibrations. Parsed $VNYMR string, to get accel, gyro, orientation (roll, pitch, yaw) and magnetometer data and analyzed the data for Allan variance.
